# Ark Ascended SDK

This is a 8 hours project that I made after buying Ark Ascended.


## Installation

git clone the project or just download it directly

```bash
git clone
```
    
## Things to know

This source is not even close of being optimized. It is a source written in a hurry. It currently has Dino ESP, Player ESP, Loot ESP and a Dino Movement Exploit.
This source was written because there are no open source external sources for Ark Ascended.

I don't offer any support for this. Using this driver will get you INSTANTLY banned by BE, so you have to add your own bypass or use this source just for learning.
